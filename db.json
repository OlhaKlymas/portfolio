  "about": [
    "I have been engaged in frontend development since 2018, I have strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. During this time, I have implemented many interesting projects of different levels of complexity - from a simple landing page to an online store.",
    "I have experience working with the VUE framework, and I also know REACT. My portfolio also is based on VUE framework :)",
    "I developed various online stores and landing pages using WordPress and Opencart. On the sites which are based on WordPress, I applied different plugins like Elementor, Woocommerce, Advanced custom fields, Ajax search for woocommerce, etc.",
    "I have implemented Visicom API to get customer addresses using the map, Plektan CRM system (for realtors) via the REST API, and WP REST API to implement filters and post pages on the site which is based on WordPress.",
    "I`m working on SalesForce Commerce Cloud (Demandware) projects now so have experience with Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA).",
    "Also, I am teaching courses in HTML&CSS, JavaScript Base, and JavaScript Advanced. I have graduated more than 80 students and more of them became Junior Frontend Developers. Since last October, I am taking part in the project ІТ Generation of the Ministry of Digital Transformation in Ukraine and partners. It helps Ukrainians to be able to get a new qualification free. I have graduated 24 students with this project."
